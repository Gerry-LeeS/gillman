   fx-frayed-ticket.css — Waterlogged / Frayed Playbill Edges
   
   Gives the circus frame irregular, torn edges like an old
   poster that's been submerged. Uses clip-path on the frame
   and a ragged overlay.
   
   Usage:  Add <link rel="stylesheet" href="fx-frayed-ticket.css">
   Remove: Delete the link tag.
